## 👋 Hi there, I'm Gracee! 

I am a software engineer who values human connection and relationships, maintaining a people-first approach in everything I do. My unique blend of advertising and software engineering experience allows me to create impactful, user-centric applications. 

As a creative and analytical self-starter with a proven track record of leading projects from ideation to completion, I thrive in dynamic environments.

👩‍💻 Some of the tech stack I use (and love) the most:
• Javascript (+ Typescript)
• React
• Next.js
• Node
• Express
• PostgreSQL
• Python/Flask

## 💡 Currently...
• leveling up my skills in Typescript 
• Volunteering on Next.js
